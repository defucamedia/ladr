        Founded in 1994, LADR is a team of energetic professionals with a specific interest in placemaking.  Our overarching goal is to work with clients, consultants and communities to create meaningful spaces through creative and informed design.  We are thoughtful listeners, sensitive facilitators, talented designers and respected project managers.  We have a history of positive outcomes; this, we believe, stems from our investment in building relationships with clients, consultant teams, project stakeholders and the communities in which we live and work.

        We believe Landscape Architecture is the balanced integration of art and science, cultural awareness, and aesthetics. We view economic, environmental and intellectual sustainability as an inherent aspect of good design and not an independent design style itself.

        Our portfolio includes public plazas, campuses and school grounds, restored habitats including reforestation, stormwater management and climate adaptation, urban agriculture, park and subdivision master plans, green roofs and living walls, community engagement and all areas of development. We have worked with public, private and not-for-profit clients and with a wide range of consultant teams and contractors across BC.
