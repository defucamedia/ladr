        Founded in 1994, LADR Landscape Architects is an established Vancouver Island based full service Landscape Architectural firm comprising an energetic results-oriented team of professionals. Our projects range from small to large scale developments including schools and campuses, public space, parks and greenways, residential and commercial developments, habitat protection and restoration, and urban agriculture. Our portfolio includes work across Vancouver Island, on the lower mainland, in northern BC, and southern Saskatchewan.

        We work with clients and associates on a daily basis to develop schematic, preliminary and detail designs, and to provide contract administration and field services.  We are experienced primary consultants and have led teams comprising biologists, civil and geotechnical engineers, agrologists, quantity surveyors, architects and horticulturists.

        The LADR team shares the belief that Landscape Architecture is the balanced integration of art and science, cultural awareness, and aesthetics. We view economic, environmental and intellectual sustainability as an inherent aspect of good design and not an independent design style itself. Our work is inspired by a broad range of thoughtful design, whether it is in landscape, architecture, fine art, graphics, fashion, photography, dance, or other field. We collectively and individually seek opportunities for creative exploration, and bring this enthusiasm to our projects.

        Our over-arching goal is to create distinct, engaging and sustainable landscapes for our clients and community. We take this goal very seriously and have, over the past 20 years, established a loyal client base with whom we have created numerous memorable and award-winning landscapes. We believe the success of these projects is attributable to our ability to listen with intent, to respond in an intelligent, innovative and responsible manner, and to collaborate with stakeholders and the design team.
